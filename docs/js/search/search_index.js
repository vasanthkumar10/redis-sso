It allows generating SSO redirection URLs and validating SSO tokens with built-in Redis-based session management.\nFeatures\n\nInitialize SSO SDK with Redis integration\nGenerate SSO redirection URLs\nValidate SSO tokens\nSecure token storage with expiration handling\n\nOwner\nDeveloped and maintained by Vasizebron Technologies.\nInstallation\nExample :npm install @your-org/ssosdkUsage\nImport the SSOSdk\nExample :import { SSOSdk } from '@your-org/ssosdk'Initialize the SDK\nExample :const ssoSdk = new SSOSdk({\n  REDIS_CONFIG: {\n    /* Redis configurations */\n  },\n  SSO_CONFIG: {\n    SSO_TOKEN_EXPIRY_IN_SECS: 3600,\n    WEB_APP_URL: 'https://your-app.com/sso/'\n  }\n})\n\nawait ssoSdk.initialize()Generate SSO Redirection URL\nExample :const { redirectionURL } = await ssoSdk.generate({\n  userId: '12345',\n  redirectUri: 'https://your-app.com/dashboard'\n})\nconsole.log('SSO URL:', redirectionURL)Validate SSO Token\nExample :const userData = await ssoSdk.validate({ token: 'generated-token' })\nconsole.log('User Data:', userData)API Reference\ninitialize()\nInitializes the SSO SDK instance and establishes a Redis connection.\nExample :await ssoSdk.initialize()generate(attrs: SSOGenerateProp): Promise\nGenerates an SSO redirection URL with a unique token stored in Redis.\nExample :const { redirectionURL } = await ssoSdk.generate({ userId: '12345' })validate(attrs: SSOValidateProp): Promise\nValidates an SSO token and retrieves the associated user data.\nExample :const userData = await ssoSdk.validate({ token: 'generated-token' })Error Handling\nThe SDK throws SSOError in case of errors. Common error types:\n\nSSO_SDK_NOT_INITIALIZED_ERROR: SDK not initialized before calling methods.\nREDIS_ERROR: Redis operation failure.\nSSO_TOKEN_EXPIRED_ERROR: Invalid or expired SSO token.\n\n🎯 License\nThis project is licensed under the MIT License.\n\n📬 Contact\n\nAuthor: Vasanthkumar\nGitHub: @vasanthkumar10\nEmail: vasizebron10@gmail.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"license.html":{"url":"license.html","title":"getting-started - license","body":"\n                   \n\nMIT License\nCopyright (c) 2024 VASANTHKUMAR V\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all\ncopies or substantial portions of the Software.\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
